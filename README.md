# Fears_data_processing

Data collected from a survey-based pilot study of the fears of individuals within the US. This data was conducted as a pilot study to determine whether or not students were satisfied with the survey design.

Here is a description of each of the variables contained within the dataset.
```
Fear = “Which of the following are you most afraid of?”
Greatest = “If your greatest fear is not listed, please list below.”
Impact = “On a scale of 1-10 how much does this fear impact your life?”
Past = “Is your fear based on a past experience?”
Encounter = “How often do you encounter your fear?”
Overcome = “In your opinion, will you ever be able to overcome your fear?”
Embarrassed = “Are you embarrassed by your fear”
```
